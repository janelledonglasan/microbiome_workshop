## USF OmicsHub Microbiome Data-Analysis Workshop Materials

These folders contain all presentations, data, tutorials and code to be provided during the workshop. 

Please create a pull request if files need to be updated so that others can make sure the code runs smoothly. The OmicsHub GitPage also links to files in this repos, so any changes to other materials including different names we need a pull request to ensure the website still works with the correct links. 



Thanks! :)
